Now that I'm officially on th market, A little objection handling early on goes a long way.
This post is designed for talent acquisition speclalists and their stakeholders.

## You’re in Noosa, We’re in X. Is that a problem?  

It hasn't been for the last decade. That's not confirmation bias either.

Since the pandemic most first meetings and almost all BAU interactions occur virtually.
I've found customers & colleagues don’t care to see beneath your face but what value you represent.

Still - I love to travel. The airport is close with constant flights. 
I’m only 1.5 hours away from Sydney or Brisbane and have no problem travelling overseas to activate my team, visit a customer, or go to market <acronym data-title="In Real Life">IRL</acronym>. 

## Your were an X, we need a Y.

I'd urge you to talk to me about <acronym data-title="Situation Task Action Response">STAR</acronym>'s relevant to you.
As a lifelong fixer, I've intimately performed a broad range of roles beyond my job titles - either as a stop-gap or due to a critical imperative.  

My experience has crossed between towers very successfully before.
11 years ago I became a brand manager for APAC - it was my first Marketing role and a jump from Engineering.  I likened brand management to experience design and took unique skills with me.  
My remit expanded to lead a team covering LATAM and EMEA and my processes set a benchmark that took over the NA teams. 
Outfit was one of those outcomes.  Following that I jumped to field strategy and execution and performed well there too.  
I then joined Outfit managing emerging technologies, then and successfully identified, pitched, and closed our acquisition. 
You have to be multi-disciplinary to do what I’ve done.  Soft skills and hard skills in equal measure. 


##  What if you're the wrong bet as a hire ?

We'll agree on metrics early on. 
If either of us recognise an issue, we will communicate early and I'll respond.  
I commit to you that it won’t be wasted time.  
Creating ancillary value is a trademark of mine.   
Always leave the campsite better than when you found it. 

You’ll be left with a lot more than you have right now 
Right now you probably have an open req sitting idle; Use it on me.

My record shows loyalty and a long tenure to the companies and roles that I work within.
I don’t gamble, so when I place a bet, It’s to win.  
If I've applied for a role with you, I think there's a fit. 
You’d be hard pressed to find a better bet.
