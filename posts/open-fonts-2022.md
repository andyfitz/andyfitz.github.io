This weekend I was lucky enough to present at https://linux.conf.au with a little preparation help from living legend <a href="https://twitter.com/davelab6">Dave Crossland</a> (thanks mate).

I lightly touched on <a href="outfit.io/">Outfit's</a> experience releasing <a href="https://outfit.io/outfit-font">The Outfit Font</a> to the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit">Google Fonts Library</a> and how incredibly mature the technical rigor and discipline around publishing an open source font has become.

Sadly this was a virtual event but the good news is you can watch the recording below if keen:

The slides contain handy details so here they are:
