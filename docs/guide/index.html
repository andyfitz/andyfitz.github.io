<h2 id="how-i-view-success">How I view success <a class="direct-link" href="#how-i-view-success">#</a></h2>
<p>Success closely follows my <strong>values</strong> and my <strong>mantra</strong> which you can <a href="/">explore on my homepage</a>.<br>
Beyond that, I have wartime and peacetime modes; success can be framed within each:</p>
<div class="twocol">
<div>
<h3 id="peacetime">Peacetime <a class="direct-link" href="#peacetime">#</a></h3>
<p>Success looks very <dfn data-title="Good Change: Continuously Improving">kaizen</dfn>, ideally it’s fast non-linear growth of the business I directly contribute to.  Optimizing for high margins, and fortifying advantages.<br>
Success is forward-looking, creatively inspired, where risk is self-healing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 id="wartime">Wartime <a class="direct-link" href="#wartime">#</a></h3>
<p>Success looks like existentially-bound innovation, unconventional alliances, and clear minded reality checks.<br>
Success is grounded, constantly-measured, fighting with everything then winning.</div></p>
</div>
I’ve enjoyed both in equal measure and sometimes operate bimodally across facets of  work.  Colleagues have seen me thrive in wartime, but like most: I personally prefer peacetime.
<h2 id="how-i-communicate">How I communicate <a class="direct-link" href="#how-i-communicate">#</a></h2>
<p>I’m direct and honest but also kind.<br>
I try very hard to call a spade a spade without getting punched in the mouth.  Meaning, I'll write with considered language yet be very candid interpersonaly with those I trust.</p>
<p>Logistically:</p>
<div class="time-management">
<div><svg viewbox="0 0 8 7"><path d="M5 5Q1 5 1 3t3-2 3 2c0 1-.2 1.6-1 2v1Z" /></svg><p>
I thrive via <b>instant message</b> chat when it's ad-hoc to make quick decisions.</p></div>
<div><svg viewbox="0 0 8 7"><path d="M1 5V1H7V5zM1 1 4 3 7 1" /></svg><p>
<b>Email</b> is where I prefer well-perpared communication, responding with focused and consided replies. </p></div>
<div><svg viewbox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M3 2a2.5 2.5 0 1 0 .001 0M5 1a2.5 2.5 0 1 0 .001 0"/></svg><p>I enjoy <b>scheduled  1:1’s</b> for the colleagues I feel more distant from as well as for a cadence with my team. I don’t waste these and 3 per quarter is plenty among all other contact.</p></div>
<div><svg viewbox="0 0 8 8"><path d="m4 .5a3.5 3.5 0 10.001 0M4 2V4H6" /></svg><p>I’ve found broadcasting <b>weekly office hours</b> works well - it lowers the barrier to interacting cross functionally. </p></div>
<div><svg viewbox="0 0 8 7"><path d="M1 1h6v5H1zm0 1h6M2 1v1m4-1v1M4 5V3l-.5.3"/></svg><p>I keep my calendar <b>as lean as possible</b> in order to welcome in-flight, unnplanned work that aligns with priorities.</p></div>
<div><svg viewbox="0 0 8 8"><path d="M 1.5 1 V 7 H 6.5 V 1 H 4 V 3 L 3.5 2 L 3 3 V 1z"/></svg><p>I record any <b>institutional memory</b> to rapidly enable colleagues. Usually this occurs in-context where the work is being done or via an LMS. I enjoy briefing and onboarding real-time also.</p></div>
</div>
Realistically, I can adapt to other modes of communication but the above are my preferred for their given purpose.
<h2 id="what-may-annoy-you">What may annoy you <a class="direct-link" href="#what-may-annoy-you">#</a></h2>
<h4 id="infodumping">Infodumping <a class="direct-link" href="#infodumping">#</a></h4>
<p>It’s something I do and a common neurodivergent trait.<br>
There’s a difference between me telling you what you need to know, and excitedly sharing detail only very engaged enthusiasts would find critical.</p>
<p>When I’m sharing information for a task, <strong>I always frame it</strong>:<br>
&quot;<em>For this purpose let’s remember</em>…&quot;<br>
&quot;<em>I suggest you/we __ because</em>…&quot;<br>
&quot;<em>Keep in mind</em> …&quot;<br>
&quot;<em>I’ve learned and you should know</em> …&quot;</p>
<p>If this context is absent, I am assuming you have the same level of excitement for detail that I do and am missing the mark.<br>
Cutting me off and saying “I don’t care” or “another time” is absolutely fine.<br>
I’ve never been offended by someone wanting to simplify communication. It doesn't hurt my feelings or change my perception of you. If anything I appreciate knowing when you don’t need more information and that the task at hand is obvious.<br>
By contrast, only geeking out and not resolving outstanding work can be a problem for us both.  If we’re working together, we don’t have an academic relationship. I trust those I work with to accept information given to them with the relevance they need to perform their role.</p>
<h4 id="attention-isn%E2%80%99t-praise%2C-praise-is-praise">Attention isn’t praise, praise is praise <a class="direct-link" href="#attention-isn%E2%80%99t-praise%2C-praise-is-praise">#</a></h4>
<p>Most relevant for anyone reporting to me.<br>
I focus on problems and opportunities more than the areas I trust and know are well-run.  It becomes clear over time that I delight in recognizing and rewarding <acronym data-title="Business As Usual">BAU</acronym> just as much as I do milestones — shining a light on contributions in all areas.</p>
<p>In the short-term, avoid misjudging my focus for recognition or favouritism.<br>
I could be spending more hours with your peers than you if they have more areas of improvement. I could also be spending more hours with a talent because I’m investing where there’s more existing skill for an immediate objective.  What I appear to be focussing on isn’t a metric of your impact and I make sure everyone knows that.</p>
<h2 id="what-gains-and-loses-my-trust">What gains and loses my trust <a class="direct-link" href="#what-gains-and-loses-my-trust">#</a></h2>
<h4 id="sharing-our-blindspots-builds-trust.">Sharing our blindspots builds trust. <a class="direct-link" href="#sharing-our-blindspots-builds-trust.">#</a></h4>
<p>I’m naturally a gap filler and a room-maker. If I can trust that you’re sharing your hardest problems with me, I’ll perform to my best to solve for them.<br>
If you clearly demonstrate a passion and talent for an area, I’ll be grateful for your contributions and make sure I’m amplifying or giving you autonomy.</p>
<h4 id="a-critical-attitude-can-both-create-trust-or-erode-trust.">A critical attitude can both create trust or erode trust. <a class="direct-link" href="#a-critical-attitude-can-both-create-trust-or-erode-trust.">#</a></h4>
<p>Being generous enough to be in open disagreement earns my trust and greatly influences what actions I take for the better. If you make the effort to communicate concerns, I make the effort to hear, understand, and address them when I can.<br>
Some encounters may end in a ‘disagree and commit’ scenario for either party. But by doing this my respect for you will grow and I'll trust you more after any reigourous debate.<br>
Being a surprise detractor for extended periods by contrast, can lure me into a combative stance where I chase wartime success. It’s on us both to be comfortable being openly critical. I strive to ensure safety and reward disagreement as a valuable contribution. I detest dissent manufactured in secret without having the opportunity to be consulted.</p>
<h4 id="i-find-trusting-the-second-time-is-easier">I find trusting the second time is easier <a class="direct-link" href="#i-find-trusting-the-second-time-is-easier">#</a></h4>
<p>You may have learned the <em>crumpled bit of paper</em> visual metaphor for trust.<br>
Easy to do, impossible to completely undo.<br>
That's not entirely how I think of it. Hard lessons drive predictability and I value teachable moments on the way to long term trust. Failure is good and I look at patterns more than isolated incidents that don't feel good but can be learned from.</p>
<h4 id="failure-early-and-often-but-never-the-same">Failure early and often but never the same <a class="direct-link" href="#failure-early-and-often-but-never-the-same">#</a></h4>
<p>We're part of an inherently optimistic species and that optimism drove the progress needed to evolve.<br>
If you become aware commitments are no longer realistic, I need to know.<br>
If that's a common theme I need help getting to the cause.</p>
<h2 id="my-strengths">My strengths <a class="direct-link" href="#my-strengths">#</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Seeing potential</li>
<li>Communicating Ideas</li>
<li>Executing heuristics and aesthetics together</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m good at identifying where technology can solve a given problem.<br>
That’s broad but so is technology, and so are problems.  My strength is letting value lead the way and connecting vast moving pieces, talented collaborators, and winning buy-in by directly contributing.<br>
This extends specifically to prototyping, proof of concepts, pitches, and decisions regarding investment.</p>
<p>I’m well versed in communicating complex ideas visually and through storytelling. These skills help me share a vision with a wider audience and win customers or contributors.</p>
<p>I'm very capable at marrying heuristic needs to aesthetic opportunities in real deliverables.<br>
To me this is <a href="/posts/my-mantra/" target="_blabk">doing justice to good work</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Solving big problems with fantastic experiences.</li>
<li>Creating outstanding engagement with measurable outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-growth-areas">My growth areas <a class="direct-link" href="#my-growth-areas">#</a></h2>
<h4 id="accepting-constraints-that-i-believe-can-be-changed">Accepting constraints that I believe can be changed <a class="direct-link" href="#accepting-constraints-that-i-believe-can-be-changed">#</a></h4>
<p>I'm sure you've heard sales complain about the quality of marketing-led inquiries.<br>
Or seen engineering leads call for more seniority in their talent.<br>
I've personally had to recognise that my business wasn't a business but a feature within a much more lucrative market.</p>
<p>I try to appreciate opportunities by learning what is at the outer limits of best efforts. I take ownership and am grateful for fixed variables, yet I'm still learning to be satisfied when the status quo is in-fact enough.<br>
You can always work with what you’ve got;<br>
I’m working on being satisfied with that.</p>
<h4 id="communicating-flexibility">Communicating flexibility <a class="direct-link" href="#communicating-flexibility">#</a></h4>
<p>My conversation-style is a passionate one designed to attract, energise, and provoke reciprocity.<br>
The negative side of this, is that it's hard for me to not come across as a zealot at times.<br>
In the words of <a href="https://daringfireball.net" target="_blank">John Gruber</a>: &quot;Strong ideas loosely held is the path to success&quot;.<br>
Like anyone else, I don't know what I don't know and when the facts change, I change my mind.   I'm taking more moments to make sure people around me know we're never too far down a path for me to be wrong despite the commited vocabulary.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-expect-from-people-i-manage">What I expect from people I manage <a class="direct-link" href="#what-i-expect-from-people-i-manage">#</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Openness &amp; Trust</li>
<li>Taking ownership</li>
<li>Bringing your best at your worst</li>
</ol>
<p>We all have days where we aren't feeling it,  I expect you to be open and ask for help at those times. When this happens, I can augment your temporary weakness, not replace your core strengths. Doing your best is all I can ask.</p>
<p>My management style pivots between being in the weeds and</p>
<h2 id="how-i-give-and-receive-feedback">How I give and receive feedback <a class="direct-link" href="#how-i-give-and-receive-feedback">#</a></h2>
<p>I  prefer giving and receiving a mixture of formal and informal feedback at a regular and quarterly cadence.  Direct feedback helps in real time, formal feedback builds institutional memory and can be invaluable when bringing new leadership on board.</p>
<p>As a manager I try to build a moat around your talent and make otherwise invisible contributions tangible and measurable assets to an organisation.</p>
<p>As a resource I thrive on lateral contribution and the resulting direct feedback.<br>
I need major contributions recognised formally so that I continue to be motivated and invest in those areas.</p>
