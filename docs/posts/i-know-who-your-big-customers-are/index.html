<p>Competitive intelligence is a big deal, it can turn a speculative gamble into a sure-thing.  With the right insight: we fish where the fish are, can plan to win, and campaign to eat the market from the top down. <br>
If you're new in the game without a killer funnel or flywheel (ugh buzzword fatigue)  it can be easier to churn a dissatisfied customer already spending with your competitor than it is to find and teach a new prospect what you are all about.</p>
<h3 id="so-what-can-saas-do-when-facing-a-glut-of-competitors%3F">So what can SaaS do when facing a glut of competitors? <a class="direct-link" href="#so-what-can-saas-do-when-facing-a-glut-of-competitors%3F">#</a></h3>
<p>Firstly, celebrate, market validation is the greatest gift.<br>
Secondly, get a lay of the land - know where you stand.</p>
<p>There are commercial platforms that offer these kinds of tools - I'm not going to link them because I've never tried them.  But if you're happy to roll up your sleeves and run a few command line scripts, this is for you.</p>
<p>In  this article, I'll cover three techniques</p>
<ol>
<li>Search trigger</li>
<li>Name enumeration</li>
<li>Door knocking</li>
</ol>
<p>This is so that you can</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify large accounts at other vendors.</li>
<li>Track when they sign up and churn</li>
<li>Learn how fast competitors are growing</li>
</ul>
<p>You can do plenty of this on your own workstation ad-hoc, or set up a VPS to run constant reports over time.</p>
<p>So firstly let me disclose the important points:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is not meant to encourage any illegal or unethical activity</li>
<li>You are responsible for how you leverage the learnings of this article.</li>
<li>I am not a lawyer or from the infosec industry; this does not constitute professional advice.</li>
<li>You will use your own competitor and prospect names</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-you-will-need">What you will need <a class="direct-link" href="#what-you-will-need">#</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A list of your competitor domains<br>
(any/all domains they use to host their customers if they use multiple for different storefronts or products)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A list of target accounts<br>
(say the top 10 thousand global companies by market cap or something as simple as the Forbes 500, or even just the ~ 100 businesses you are targeting right now) - Gather this yourself, there are commercial services offering solutions built on these lists but this is a DIY article.  Easy enough to get a hold of.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay with that out of the way, we can start with the obvious.</p>
<h1 id="search">Search <a class="direct-link" href="#search">#</a></h1>
<p>SaaS companies love and need SEO, many encourage partial/full public usage of their platforms wherever possible.  Think github, codepen, even my employer Brandfolder.</p>
<p>Their user activity might be mostly private, but it's in the vendors best interest to have as many <code>vendorname.com/yourcompany</code> instances as possible.</p>
<p>So scripting a recurring search with tools like googler (<a href="https://github.com/jarun/googler">https://github.com/jarun/googler</a>) like <code>site:competitordomain.com prospectName</code> is the easiest way of learning if an organisation has begun using a competitor.<br>
Seems simple but this is frequently overlooked and you can skip the awkward &quot;who are you working with&quot; question in discovery calls.</p>
<h1 id="domain-enumeration">Domain Enumeration <a class="direct-link" href="#domain-enumeration">#</a></h1>
<p>This one is similar but different to search in that even fully closed platforms often offer up whitelabelling subdomains as a feature to their accounts. <code>Companyname.competitordomain</code></p>
<p>For this we can use services like <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/Amass/">Amass</a> and <a href="https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r">sublist3r</a> .</p>
<p>These tools will use a variety of techniques and do their best to surface all the custom subdomains  - giving you an idea of who is a customer and who is not.</p>
<p>While not giving you target company lists, I'm not a monster. Here's a handy ignore list to clean up the results you get. <a href="https://gist.github.com/andyfitz/227921862fb81a7843a05479255711a9">https://gist.github.com/andyfitz/227921862fb81a7843a05479255711a9</a></p>
<h1 id="sso-door-knocking">SSO Door knocking <a class="direct-link" href="#sso-door-knocking">#</a></h1>
<p>I saved the best till last.  Lots of private-productivity SaaS environments neither subdomain nor subpath their customers.<br>
But like death and taxes, one other thing is certain:  Enterprise accounts demand SSO/IDP integration. So if they are a small team logging in with username/password - you may never know, but if they are a big customer, you'll be able to confirm relatively easily.</p>
<p>I'm not even sure if this technique actually called something else - but I've called it door knocking because you're simply</p>
<ol>
<li>Visiting a website's login form</li>
<li>Knocking it with a targeted domain's email.</li>
<li>Checking the response sizes to confirm / disprove the account</li>
</ol>
<p>Over time, this helps you track acquisition and churn by large enterprise accounts.</p>
<p>I'm not going to share how this is automated technically other than to say it involves rotating VPS proxies,  puppeteer, and form submission which is dead simple.<br>
Here's a handy tutorial from Scrapingbeee that doesn't require use of their service <a href="https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/submit-form-puppeteer/">https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/submit-form-puppeteer/</a>.<br>
After reading that, you'll get the idea. automating requires you to set up a method for each competitor you want to track.</p>
<p>Say you try knocking their loginform with <code>giuseppe@companyname.com</code>.</p>
<p>If you get the same size response as <code>giuseppe@domaindoesnotexist.com</code> (or no response), then you can validate that companyname is either a small-time customer on a team plan or not a customer at all because they haven't implemented SSO.</p>
<p>Again, you can do this manually by simply visiting your competitor website.<br>
Selecting the email option, typing in <code>anyname@yourprospectdomain.com</code> and seeing if you hit an SSO gate. Handy right ?</p>
<p>So that's it for now.</p>
<p>I hope this was insightful.</p>
