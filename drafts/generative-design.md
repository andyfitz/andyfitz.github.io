Why design a single piece when you can design a system with countless unique permutations?

In this tutorial I'm going to show you how to make artwork using very simple vanilla javascript and SVG.

There are great frameworks like P5.js and Three.js for generative art but getting the basics first sets you up for a long and happy relationship with this style of creative production.


## preamble


Plenty of brands have gone the dynamic brand route and we're lucky to have a few of them as customers of Outfit.io

One of the great benefits of Outfit.io or Make.cm templates is that it's very easy to have artwork that is unique every time for end users which can make for a far more engaging and dynamic aesthetic on large builds like events or media.
