# brand learnings  


When you start as a designer you learn the basics of layout, and typography, you respect not to trivialise those lessons.

As you grow you bear witness to exceptions, compromises, and new work due to the reality the tech of the day. 

I've been lucky to bear witness to the largest organisations on the planet thanklessly but jealously protecting their aesthetic while unleashing new workloads upon the design community.

What they keep is as important as what they throw away.
